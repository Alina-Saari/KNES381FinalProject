The rocket was the first project that I completed where I learned the basics of python including ending lines, printing and basic code. Next was the Tic Tac Toe modifications where I learned and implemented boolean logic and conditional statements to improve the original code while using Jupyter notebook for the first time. Lastly was the data analysis on Keggle, where I learned how to use Keggle but also how to use python language to analysis data and create graphs.</div>
